```
As a user,
So I can keep my money somewhere,
I want to open an account.

As a user,
So that I can add money to this account,
I want to deposit an amount given.

As a user,
So that I can access my stored amount,
I want to withdraw an amount from my account.

As a user,
So that I can view my previous transactions,
I want to see a statement with my withdrawals, deposits, dates, and balance.
